## Finish the Zoho Mail SMTP setup (code is ready, ops not done)

Backend + frontend code is wired up (`commit 75ff8b6`). To actually
deliver mail, run through the following — none of it is reversible
without breaking outbound email, so do it on the deploy host in one
sitting.

1. **Zoho Mail Admin — Send-As identities** (admin.zoho.eu → Mail → Mail
   Accounts → pick the primary mailbox → Send Mail As).
   - Add `faktury@simplecrm.cz`. Verify via the confirmation link Zoho
     sends to that address (route the inbox via DNS first if it doesn't
     exist yet — see §3).
   - Add `info@simplecrm.cz`. Same verification step.

2. **App password** (account.zoho.com → Security → App Passwords).
   - Generate a new app password labelled "SimpleCRM SMTP".
   - Copy it — Zoho only shows it once. This is the
     `SMTP_PASSWORD` value below; do NOT use the regular account
     password (Zoho 2FA blocks regular-password SMTP auth).

3. **DNS on simplecrm.cz** (registrar: wedos.cz or equivalent). All four
   are required for Gmail/Outlook to stop binning our mail.
   - **MX** → `mx.zoho.eu` (priority 10), `mx2.zoho.eu` (20),
     `mx3.zoho.eu` (50).
   - **SPF** TXT at the apex: `v=spf1 include:zohomail.eu ~all`.
     Replace any prior SPF — only one is allowed.
   - **DKIM** TXT — Zoho generates the selector + key under Mail Admin
     → Domains → simplecrm.cz → Email Configuration → DKIM. Paste the
     full TXT record verbatim, then click Verify in Zoho.
   - **DMARC** TXT at `_dmarc.simplecrm.cz`:
     `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@simplecrm.cz`.
     Once SPF + DKIM are passing for a week, tighten `p=quarantine` →
     `p=reject`.

4. **Coolify env vars** (Coolify UI → SimpleCRM service → Environment).
   Default `SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.eu`, `SMTP_PORT=465`, `SMTP_USE_SSL=true`
   are baked into the config — only the two below need setting:
   ```
   SMTP_USERNAME=<primary-mailbox>@simplecrm.cz
   SMTP_PASSWORD=<app password from step 2>
   ```
   Save → redeploy.

5. **Smoke test** (post-deploy):
   - Hit `/app/feedback` in the live app, submit a test report → check
     `info@simplecrm.cz` for delivery within ~30 s.
   - Trigger an invoice send from `/admin` → confirm the customer
     mailbox receives it from `faktury@simplecrm.cz` with the PDF
     attached.
   - Run `mail-tester.com` against both addresses; aim for 10/10. If a
     score is below 8, SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment is the usual culprit.

Claude Zone here:
- After real Stripe is wired up: add a scheduled `process_period_rollovers()`
  job that walks subscriptions whose `current_period_ends_at` has passed and
  applies `pending_plan_id`, `pending_seat_count`, and
  `pending_user_deactivations` automatically. Today the super-admin Aktivovat
  path is the only apply route — fine for the no-Stripe phase.

## ComGate go-live audit follow-ups (from docs/prompts/COMGATE_GO_LIVE_AUDIT.md)

Fixed in-session — see commits ahead of origin/main:
- Q4: duplicate "Začít zdarma" landing CTA replaced with the canonical
  "Vyzkoušet 30 dní zdarma".
- Q5: live cost preview as admin edits seat count; annual-savings now
  shows both % and absolute Kč in Settings → Organizace.
- Q1 copy fix: bank-transfer pending state on /app/billing/return no
  longer claims "pár vteřin"; tells the user it may take hours and the
  invoice will arrive on settle.
- Q2 (partial): invoice service now snapshots the org's real ICO / DIČ
  / structured address into the invoice instead of just the name. Still
  needs a UI so the founder can edit those fields — see open-question
  below.
- Q12: startup log now emits ERROR-level warnings when
  `COMGATE_TEST_MODE=true` or `SMTP_HOST` is empty, so a misconfigured
  prod deploy is loud in monitoring.

Open audit findings (need separate work):
- **Q2 (UI gap):** the `Organization` model carries `ico` / `dic` /
  `address_street` / `address_city` / `address_zip` / `legal_form` /
  `billing_email`, but there is NO settings form to fill them in. The
  invoice service now reads them when populated (fallback: org name
  only), but until we add the UI, every newly issued invoice will be
  missing IČO/address. Recommended: extend
  `frontend/src/app/settings/SettingsPage.tsx::OrganizationSection`
  with an "Údaje pro fakturaci" sub-form that takes IČO + ARES autofill
  (reuse `useLookupRegistry`) + manual edit for DIČ / billing-email.
  Must NOT block the trial — admin only sees a soft warning ("Faktura
  bude bez IČO; doplňte před první platbou") when fields are empty.
- **Q3 (UI verification):** trial-expiry pay-gate logic in
  `is_app_access_allowed` is correct — fresh trials lock immediately
  at period end, past-due paying orgs get the 7-day grace. Salespeople
  hit the same gate via `require_active_trial_or_subscription` on
  every PROTECTED_DEPS router, so the lockout is org-wide. **Not
  separately verified end-to-end on production** — recommend running
  through the dev `_freeze_trial` super-admin helper before launch
  with a salesperson account to confirm the gate fires for them too.
- **Q7 (ISDOC delivery):** the invoice mailer attaches the PDF only.
  ISDOC XML is generated + stored under `invoice.isdoc_object_key` but
  never attached to the customer email. Czech B2B convention is to
  bundle both. Low priority — add a second `EmailAttachment` only if a
  customer asks for it.
- **Q10 (refunds):** there's no customer-facing or admin refund flow.
  `Charge.status` enum supports `"refunded"` but no endpoint calls
  `ComGateClient` (which DOES have `refund` mapped on `_Endpoints`).
  Refunds today happen via the ComGate portal manually + a
  super-admin-issued credit note. Fine for v1 since refunds are rare;
  build the flow when the first dispute lands.
- **Q11 (locale):** CZK + Czech UI/PDF only. Frontend has no language
  switcher, no English email templates. Fine for the CZ-only launch.
- **Q13 (audit log completeness):** every payment-state transition is
  audited via `BillingAuditLog` (subscription_chose_plan, activate,
  cancel_self_serve, seat_*_) and via `WebhookEvent` for the raw
  ComGate payloads. **Not separately stress-tested** — recommend
  running through the production smoke test in `docs/comgate-setup.md`
  §6 and confirming every state change writes a row.

Production env checklist (matches `docs/comgate-setup.md` §7):
- [ ] `COMGATE_TEST_MODE=false` (startup log now warns when true)
- [ ] `COMGATE_MERCHANT_ID` + `COMGATE_SECRET` = production values
- [ ] `COMGATE_RETURN_URL=https://app.simplecrm.cz/app/billing/return`
- [ ] Production webhook URL registered in ComGate portal
- [ ] `SMTP_HOST` + `SMTP_USERNAME` + `SMTP_PASSWORD` set per the Zoho
      block above
- [ ] DNS for `simplecrm.cz` includes MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC for Zoho EU
- [ ] BillingSettings row has issuer details populated (IČO, IBAN,
      address) — without these the auto-issuance skips with a warning
- [ ] Run an end-to-end smoke test with sandbox creds first, then a
      £1 real-money test in production
